# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to loose comparisons and the handling of null and undefined values. The bug is present in the `foo` function, which attempts to handle null and undefined values differently.  However, due to the use of loose comparison, there's unexpected behavior.  The solution provided clarifies this behavior and demonstrates how to avoid this issue.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and examine the code.
3. Run `bug.js` (e.g., using Node.js).
4. Observe the output and compare it to the expected behavior.  Note that the handling of 0, NaN, and false might be unexpected with loose comparisons. 

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` uses strict equality (`===`) which helps mitigate the issues associated with loose comparison.  This provides a more robust and reliable way of handling null and undefined.
